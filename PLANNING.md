# Project Planning - ClaudeTest Task Manager

## Vision

A modern, intuitive task management application that demonstrates best practices in React development while providing a delightful user experience through thoughtful design and smooth interactions.

### Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Clean, uncluttered interface that focuses on task management
- **Performance**: Lightning-fast interactions with optimized rendering
- **Accessibility**: Usable by everyone, keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly
- **Modern Design**: Contemporary UI with gradient aesthetics and smooth animations

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── App.jsx           # Main application component (container)
├── App.css           # Application-specific styles
├── main.jsx          # Application entry point
└── index.css         # Global styles and resets
```

### Data Flow
- **State Management**: React useState hooks for local state
- **Component Communication**: Props passing and event handlers
- **Side Effects**: useEffect for persistence (future enhancement)

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Single Component Architecture**: Currently monolithic for simplicity, ready to be decomposed
2. **Functional Components**: Using hooks for modern React patterns
3. **CSS Modules Ready**: Structure supports easy migration to CSS modules
4. **No External Dependencies**: Minimal bundle size, maximum performance

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 18.3.1**: Latest stable version with concurrent features
- **Vite 7.0.4**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features without TypeScript overhead

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Git**: Version control with GitHub integration
- **npm**: Package management

### Styling Approach
- **Vanilla CSS**: Custom properties, flexbox, and grid
- **Modern CSS Features**: 
  - CSS gradients for visual appeal
  - CSS transforms for animations
  - CSS transitions for smooth interactions
  - CSS custom properties for theming (future)

## Required Tools

### Development Environment
1. **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
   - Required for npm and development server
   - Check version: `node --version`

2. **npm** (v9+ recommended)
   - Package manager for dependencies
   - Check version: `npm --version`

3. **Git**
   - Version control
   - GitHub CLI (gh) for repository management
   - Check version: `git --version`

4. **Code Editor**
   - VS Code recommended (or Cursor)
   - Extensions: ESLint, Prettier (optional)

### Browser Requirements
- **Chrome/Edge** (latest): Primary development target
- **Firefox** (latest): Secondary testing
- **Safari** (latest): macOS testing
- **Mobile browsers**: Responsive design testing

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Component Decomposition Plan
```
components/
├── TaskInput/        # Input field and add button
├── TaskList/         # List container
├── TaskItem/         # Individual task component
├── FilterBar/        # Filter buttons
└── StatusBar/        # Task counter
```

### State Management Evolution
1. **Phase 1**: Local state with useState (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Context API for global state
3. **Phase 3**: Consider Zustand or Redux Toolkit if complexity grows

### Performance Optimizations
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo for computed values
- useCallback for stable function references
- Virtual scrolling for large task lists

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Performance monitoring with Lighthouse

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build  # Creates optimized production build
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

### Hosting Options
1. **GitHub Pages**: Free, integrated with repository
2. **Vercel**: Automatic deployments, preview URLs
3. **Netlify**: Similar to Vercel with good DX
4. **Cloudflare Pages**: Fast global CDN

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Automatic deployment on main branch push
- Preview deployments for pull requests
